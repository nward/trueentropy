# trueentropy
Feeds the Linux random number generator with data that as far as I can tell is completely random and meaningless.

## Usage
Simply run trueentropy.py as root.

## Requirements
You need to install scrapy for Python, many operating systems ship a scrapy package, or you can use that pip thing.

## Compatibility
This only runs on Linux. I tested it on an Elementary OS VM I had handy, so it works on that at least.
Please submit PRs adding support for additional systems. Windows and OS X seem like good target platforms.

## Production quality
Please DO NOT use this on a production system. I would like feedback on the code, so please review it and submit PRs.
