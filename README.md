# trueentropy
Feeds the Linux random number generator with data that as far as I can tell is completely random and meaningless.

## Usage
Simply run trueentropy.py as root.

## Production quality
Please DO NOT use this on a production system. I would like feedback on the code, so please review it and submit PRs.
